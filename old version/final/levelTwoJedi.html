        <h2>Level 2 - UWB Fundamentals , Personal Jedi programming skills</h2>
        <p> CONGRATULATIONS !!! If you reading this that means you took the entering exam and you have THE CODE FORCE IN YOU. In this level you will familiar yourself with THE UNIVERSE WIDE
            WEB known as UWB. How to find simple things and simple hacks for resisting dark side codders hacks and other stuff that are actually not that cool. You will work over your
            personal skills - how to brush your hair, when to sleep and get up, how to tallk with ladys and how to use deodorant. This level is NOT FOR ABSOLUTE BEGINNERS and we will remind you
            this in every lecture doesn't matter how irritating it gets !!! You can chose between online and attendance form. In the online form you will need to learn the biggest part by yourself. We will give you some videos to watch but ... they will be always later then normal
            and with poor quality, sounds will be faster then the picture and stuff but your homework will be like the attendance form witch is kind of cОol, neah ? In the attendance form
            you will get all kind of cool stuff but you will pay more !!! WAY MORE !!! Like 4 times more !!! And we will chose the worst hours for the lecture.
            I forgot to mention the attendance form is only for the inhabitors of Tatooine ! At the end of every course you will have exam. We don't have enough working lightboards
            and if you want to pass the exams BRING ONE FROM YOUR HOME. You can byu one from "Tatooine lightboards and programming" with 10% discount but don't think that we are making any
            commercial statements in this introduction.  We are not advertising "Tatooine lightboards and programming stuff" we are just saying that if you want 10% cheaper lightboards you can byu from
            them. "Tatooine lightboards and programming stuff".

        <p> About the lecturer :</p>
        <p> Han Solo is kind a freelancer who from time to time give lectures in Force Uni. The years of freelancing made him SOLO. He doesn't like to work with other people and
        he'll do everything about money. The good thing that he is gambler and he own lot of money to Jaba. He is curently giving lections in the Force Uni for good amount of
        Galactic Credits and thats the only reason he is doing it (or at least he said so). He is good programmer and even though his mothods are cruel they work !!! </p>
