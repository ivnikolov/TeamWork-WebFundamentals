        <p> About the lecturer :</p>
        <p> This Droid  is made by Anakin Skywallker (currently known as Dart Vaidar) when he were young and worked for Master Yoda. He programme it to know the basic programming lagueges
        and now the droid is giving lectures in the first level (Anakin was good programmer from kid it seems). C3-PO is good with programming but not that good explaining it so ... you
        will get use to it. Actually this was not the droid we were looking for but ... we found him and now he is part of the Force Uni.</p>
