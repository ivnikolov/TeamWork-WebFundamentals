        <h2>Level 2 - UWB Fundamentals , Jaba Basics</h2>
        <p> CONGRATULATIONS !!! If you reading this that means you took the entering exam and you are not dead (YET). In this level you will familiar yourself with THE UNIVERSE WIDE
            WEB known as UWB. How to find simple things and simple hacks for hacking Jedi networks and other stuff that are actually not that cool. You will Learn about JABA and his
            minions - how to track them and defend versus them (have it in mind that Jaba is our general sponsor so don't hurt any of his minions or him, because you know - THE IMPERIAL SOLDIERS need
            money !!!). This level is NOT FOR ABSOLUTE BEGINNERS and we will remind you this in every lecture doesn't matter how irritating it gets !!! You can chose between online and attendance
            form. In the online form you will need to learn the biggest part by yourself. We will give you some videos to watch but ... they will be always later then normal
            and with poor quality, sounds will be faster then the picture and stuff but your homework will be like the attendance form witch is kind of cОol, neah ? In the attendance form
            you will get all kind of cool stuff but you will pay more !!! WAY MORE !!! Like 4 times more !!! And we will chose the worst hours for the lecture.
            I forgot to mention the attendance form is only for the inhabitors of the Death Star ! At the end of every course you will have exam. We don't have enough working lightboards
            and if you want to survive the exams BRING ONE FROM YOUR HOME. You can byu one from "Naboo lightboards and gadgets" with 10% discount but don't think that we are making any
            commercial statements in this introduction.  We are not advertising "Naboo lightboards and gadgets" we are just saying that if you want 10% cheaper lightboards you can byu from
            them. "Naboo lightboards and gadgets".

        <p> About the lecturer :</p>
        <p> Dath Maul is one of best performing Level 3 students. He knows the basics of the Dark Side of the force. He acctualy saw Jedi once and try to hack him with his
            lightboar but as Emperor Palpatin says - "You need to spend at least 8 to 10 hours per day in practice and in year or two you will become decent. "</p>
